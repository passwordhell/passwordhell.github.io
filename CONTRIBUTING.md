# Contributing to The Password Hall Of Shame

The Password Hall Of Shame is currently a simple YAML file.

Soon it will be turned into a shiny website.

If you know of a company with stupid password rules, please add them to the YAML file.

Stupid password rules are defined as:

- Having a maximum password length that is less than 64 characters
- Requiring a capital letter and a number or other sometimes arcane rules
- Not allowing punctuation and non-alphanumerical characters
