# The Wall Of Password Shame

This is currently a YAML database of websites which we hope to shame into action.

Password research has taught us much in the last
few decades, but little of that has penetrated
into mainstream knowledge.

We hope to educate and "shame" in a light-hearted
manner in the hopes of a more secure Web and
Internet.

# Ranking

Soon there will be a ranking system, so we can
take a weighted average of the details about each
organizations password requirements, which will
allow us to give them a "score", which can be
compared to others and hence create an ordering.
The lowest scores will be the top of the Wall Of
Shame.

# Visualizations

We are working on how to visualize how bad the
password requirements are for some of these
organizations, i.e. visualize the search space of
the password they want you to use vs arbitrary
ASCII 16 character password. Many will fall far
short.
